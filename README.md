# Just Eclipse Color Theme

This is a theme based on
[Eclipse-like light theme for macOS](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mojo2012.vscode-eclipse-theme),
which is an extension that uses the **Eclipse syntax colors**. The UI theme is
based on
[macOS Classic](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=huacnlee.theme-macos-classic).

Original by mojo2012 had keymaps and some language features, which I removed.
Additionally, the theme is tweaked to be more faithful.
