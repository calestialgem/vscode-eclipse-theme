# Eclipse-like light theme for macOS
This is a extension that uses the **Eclipse syntax colors**. The UI theme is based on [macOS Classic](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=huacnlee.theme-macos-classic)
It also contains keyboard shortcuts for eclipse (mostly for macOS) based on [Eclipse Keymap](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alphabotsec.vscode-eclipse-keybindings).

Recommended font: [Liga Menlo](https://github.com/Lipfroy/Liga-Menlo)
